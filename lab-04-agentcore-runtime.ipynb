    "## Lab 4: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 3 we scaled our Customer Support Agent by centralizing tools through AgentCore Gateway with secure authentication. Now we'll complete the production journey by deploying our agent to AgentCore Runtime with comprehensive observability. This will transform our prototype into a production-ready system that can handle real-world traffic with full monitoring and automatic scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) is a secure, fully managed runtime that empowers organizations to deploy and scale AI agents in production, regardless of framework, protocol, or model choice. It provides enterprise-grade reliability, automatic scaling, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Done):** Create Agent Prototype - Built a functional customer support agent\n",
    "- **Lab 2 (Done):** Enhance with Memory - Added conversation context and personalization\n",
    "- **Lab 3 (Done):** Scale with Gateway & Identity - Shared tools across agents securely\n",
    "- **Lab 4 (Current):** Deploy to Production - Used AgentCore Runtime with observability\n",
    "- **Lab 5:** Build User Interface - Create a customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AgentCore Runtime & Production Deployment Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Current State (Lab 1-3): Agent runs locally with centralized tools but faces production challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent runs locally in a single session\n",
    "- No comprehensive monitoring or debugging capabilities\n",
    "- Cannot handle multiple concurrent users reliably\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lab, we will have a production-ready agent infrastructure with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serverless auto-scaling to handle variable demand\n",
    "- Comprehensive observability with traces, metrics, and logging\n",
    "- Enterprise reliability with automatic error recovery\n",
    "- Secure deployment with proper access controls\n",
    "- Easy management through AWS console and APIs and support for real-world production workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding comprehensive observability with AgentCore Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, AgentCore Runtime integrates seamlessly with [AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html) to provide full visibility into your agent's behavior in production. AgentCore Observability automatically captures traces, metrics, and logs from your agent interactions, tool usage, and memory access patterns. In this lab we will see how AgentCore Runtime integrates with CloudWatch GenAI Observability to provide comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For request tracing, AgentCore Observability captures the complete conversation flow including tool invocations, memory retrievals, and model interactions. For performance monitoring, it tracks response times, success rates, and resource utilization to help optimize your agent's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the observability flow, AgentCore Runtime automatically instruments your agent code and sends telemetry data to CloudWatch. You can then use CloudWatch dashboards and GenAI Observability features to analyze patterns, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.\n",

    "*Agent now runs in AgentCore Runtime with full observability through CloudWatch, serving production traffic with auto-scaling and comprehensive monitoring. Memory and Gateway integrations from previous labs remain fully functional in the production environment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",

    "## 📚 Theory: Understanding Production Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Production Deployment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Production deployment is the process of making your AI agent available to end-users in a reliable, scalable, and monitored environment. Unlike development or testing environments where agents run on local machines, production deployment requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Availability**: The agent must be accessible 24/7 with minimal downtime\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: Automatically handle varying numbers of concurrent users\n",
    "3. **Security**: Protect user data and control access through authentication\n",
    "4. **Observability**: Monitor performance, track errors, and debug issues\n",
    "5. **Reliability**: Gracefully handle failures and recover automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AgentCore Runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Runtime is AWS's managed service for deploying AI agents to production. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serverless Architecture**: No infrastructure to manage - AWS handles servers, scaling, and maintenance\n",
    "- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjusts capacity based on incoming traffic\n",
    "- **Built-in Observability**: Integrated with CloudWatch for comprehensive monitoring\n",
    "- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any AI framework (LangChain, Strands, custom code)\n",
    "- **Container-based**: Your agent runs in Docker containers for consistency across environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Containerization**\n",
    "- Your agent code is packaged into a Docker container image\n",
    "- The container includes your code, dependencies, and runtime environment\n",
    "- Ensures your agent runs identically in development and production\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Entrypoint Function**\n",
    "- The entry point is the function that AgentCore Runtime calls when a request arrives\n",
    "- It receives the user's input and returns the agent's response\n",
    "- Decorated with `@app.entrypoint` to register it with the runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Session Management**\n",
    "- Each conversation has a unique session ID\n",
    "- Sessions maintain conversation context and memory\n",
    "- Different users have different sessions (isolation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Authentication & Authorization**\n",
    "- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) verify user identity\n",
    "- Bearer tokens are passed in HTTP headers\n",
    "- Tokens are validated before processing requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deployment Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Local Code → Docker Image → ECR Registry → AgentCore Runtime → Production\n",
    "     ↓             ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓\n",
    "  Python       Package       Store Image      Deploy          Serve Users\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observability: Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, you need to answer questions like:\n",
    "- Is the agent responding quickly enough?\n",
    "- Which tools are being used most frequently?\n",
    "- Are there any errors or failures?\n",
    "- How many concurrent users are active?\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Observability provides:\n",
    "- **Traces**: Complete record of each request (what happened, in what order)\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements (response time, success rate, etc.)\n",
    "- **Logs**: Detailed event records for debugging\n",

    "## 📚 Theory: Transforming Local Code to Runtime-Ready\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge: From Local to Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Your agent currently runs on your local machine. To deploy it to production, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Make it invokable**: The agent must respond to external requests (not just local function calls)\n",
    "2. **Handle authentication**: Verify that requests come from authorized users\n",
    "3. **Manage sessions**: Keep conversations separate for different users\n",
    "4. **Enable monitoring**: Automatically report performance and errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### The AgentCore Runtime Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore Runtime uses a simple pattern to transform your local code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Local code pattern:\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    # Your agent logic\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Runtime-ready pattern:\n",
    "from bedrock_agentcore.runtime import BedrockAgentCoreApp\n",
    "\n",
    "app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()  # Initialize the runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.entrypoint  # Register this as the entry point\n",
    "def my_function(payload, context):\n",
    "    # Same agent logic, but now receives payload and context\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "app.run()  # Start the runtime server\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Four Key Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 1: Import the Runtime App**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bedrock_agentcore.runtime import BedrockAgentCoreApp\n",
    "```\n",
    "This imports the main class that manages your agent in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 2: Initialize the App**\n",

    "app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()\n",

    "- Set up HTTP server to receive requests\n",
    "- Configure authentication validation\n",
    "- Enable automatic observability\n",
    "- Manage session routing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 3: Decorate the Entrypoint**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.entrypoint\n",
    "```\n",
    "Marks your function as the entry point. When a request arrives, this function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Line 4: Run the Runtime**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Starts the server and begins listening for requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Receive in the Entrypoint\n",
    "\n",
    "**payload**: Dictionary containing the request data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"prompt\": \"User's question or message\",\n",
    "    # Other custom fields you might include\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**context**: Object with request metadata\n",
    "```python\n",
    "context.request_headers  # HTTP headers including Authorization\n",
    "context.session_id       # Unique ID for this conversation\n",
    "context.user_id          # Authenticated user identifier\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User sends request with JWT token in `Authorization` header\n",
    "2. AgentCore Runtime validates the token\n",
    "3. Your entrypoint extracts the token from `context.request_headers`\n",
    "4. Token is passed to AgentCore Gateway for tool access\n",
    "5. Gateway validates token again before allowing tool usage\n",
    "\n",

    "**Authentication Handling:**\n",
    "- Extracts JWT token from request headers: `context.request_headers.get('Authorization', '')`\n",

    "## 📚 Theory: Observability & Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Observability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Observability is the ability to understand what's happening inside your system by examining its outputs. It's like having X-ray vision into your agent's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Three Pillars of Observability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logs**: Text records of events that happened\n",
    "   - \"User asked about warranty at 10:15 AM\"\n",
    "   - \"Tool execution started at 10:15:02 AM\"\n",
    "   - \"Response generated at 10:15:05 AM\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metrics**: Numerical measurements over time\n",
    "   - Average response time: 3.2 seconds\n",
    "   - Success rate: 98.5%\n",
    "   - Requests per minute: 45\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Traces**: End-to-end journey of a single request\n",
    "   - Request arrives → Token validated → Agent invoked → Tool called → Response sent\n",
    "   - Shows timing and dependencies between steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Observability Matters in Production\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without Observability:**\n",
    "- \"The agent is slow\" - But where is the bottleneck?\n",
    "- \"Some requests are failing\" - Which ones and why?\n",
    "- \"Users are unhappy\" - What's causing the issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Observability:**\n",
    "- \"The knowledge base search takes 5 seconds\" - Optimize that tool\n",
    "- \"Requests fail when warranty tool times out\" - Add timeout handling\n",
    "- \"90% of slow requests happen during peak hours\" - Scale up capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "### AgentCore Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "AgentCore automatically instruments your agent code to capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Request-Level Tracing:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Request ID: 123-456-789\n",
    "├─ Received user input (0ms)\n",
    "├─ Validated token (50ms)\n",
    "├─ Retrieved memory (200ms)\n",
    "├─ Executed warranty_check tool (1500ms)\n",
    "├─ Generated response (800ms)\n",
    "└─ Returned to user (2550ms total)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "- P50 latency (median): 2.1s\n",
    "- P95 latency (95th percentile): 4.5s\n",
    "- P99 latency (worst case): 8.2s\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Tracking:**\n",
    "- Authentication failures: 2%\n",
    "- Tool timeout errors: 0.5%\n",
    "- Memory retrieval errors: 0.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "### CloudWatch GenAI Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS CloudWatch provides a specialized dashboard for AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents View:**\n",
    "- See all deployed agents\n",
    "- High-level health metrics\n",
    "- Quick access to details\n",
    "\n",

    "- List of all conversations\n",
    "- Filter by user, time, or status\n",
    "- See session duration and message count\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traces View:**\n",
    "- Detailed request timeline\n",
    "- Tool invocation sequences\n",
    "- Performance bottlenecks\n",
    "- Error stack traces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading a Trace\n",
    "\n",
    "Example trace breakdown:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Span 1: HTTP Request (2550ms total)\n",
    "  Span 2: Authentication (50ms)\n",
    "  Span 3: Agent Invocation (2450ms)\n",
    "    Span 4: Memory Retrieval (200ms)\n",
    "    Span 5: Tool Execution (1500ms)\n",
    "      Span 6: Gateway Request (1400ms)\n",
    "      Span 7: Tool Processing (100ms)\n",
    "    Span 8: Response Generation (800ms)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows:\n",
    "- Most time spent in tool execution (1500ms)\n",
    "- Gateway network latency is significant (1400ms)\n",
    "- Opportunity to optimize tool performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Observability for Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identify Slow Operations:**\n",
    "1. Look at P95/P99 latencies\n",
    "2. Find spans taking longest\n",
    "3. Optimize those components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debug Errors:**\n",
    "1. Filter traces by error status\n",
    "2. Examine error messages and stack traces\n",
    "3. Identify patterns (same tool? same time?)\n",
    "4. Fix root cause\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitor User Experience:**\n",
    "1. Track session success rate\n",
    "2. Measure time to first response\n",
    "3. Monitor message round-trip time\n",
    "4. Set alerts for degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up alerts**: Get notified when error rate spikes or latency increases\n",
    "2. **Review regularly**: Check dashboards weekly to spot trends\n",
    "3. **Investigate anomalies**: When metrics deviate, dig into traces\n",
    "4. **Correlate with changes**: Did a deployment cause the issue?\n",
    "5. **Document learnings**: Build a knowledge base of common issues\n",
